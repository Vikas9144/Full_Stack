    <h3>Q.1)  What is jQuery?</h3>

    <p>jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library designed to simplify client-side scripting of HTML. It was created by John Resig in 2006 and has since become one of the most widely used JavaScript libraries.</p>
    <p>jQuery simplifies many common tasks in web development, such as:</p>
    <p>
        1) DOM manipulation: jQuery provides easy-to-use methods for selecting and manipulating DOM elements. This makes tasks like adding, removing, or modifying HTML elements much simpler and more concise.
    </p>
    <p>
        2) Event handling: jQuery allows developers to easily attach event handlers to DOM elements, such as click, hover, or submit events, without needing to worry about cross-browser compatibility issues.
    </p>
    <p>
        3) AJAX: jQuery simplifies asynchronous HTTP requests (AJAX) by providing a set of methods for making requests to a server and handling the responses, allowing for dynamic loading of content without refreshing the entire page.
    </p>
    <p>
        4) Animations: jQuery includes built-in animation effects and methods for creating animations, transitions, and visual effects on DOM elements, making it easier to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
    </p>
    <p>
        5) Utilities: jQuery provides various utility functions for tasks like iterating over arrays or objects, manipulating strings, and working with data.
